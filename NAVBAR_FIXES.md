# Navbar Rendering Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bootstrap Dependency Conflicts
- Added error handling for Bootstrap JavaScript loading
- Created fallback mechanisms when Bootstrap is not available
- Added Bootstrap initialization checks

### 2. Performance Issues
- Extracted inline CSS to separate file (`Navigation.css`)
- Removed large CSS block from JSX component
- Improved component re-render performance

### 3. Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks for localStorage access
- Added error handling for Bootstrap API calls
- Added fallback for mobile menu toggle

### 4. Route Configuration Bug
- Fixed dynamic route path mapping issue
- Corrected `/places/:placeName` route lookup
- Added error handling for route prefetching

### 5. Memory Leaks Prevention
- Replaced direct DOM manipulation with React refs
- Moved prefetching to useEffect with cleanup
- Removed unnecessary React.memo usage

### 6. Final Optimizations
- Added useMemo for route visibility calculations
- Sanitized logging to prevent log injection
- Improved TypeScript type safety
- Extracted Logo component for better maintainability
- Optimized Bootstrap initialization to run only once

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Main navbar component
2. `client/src/components/Navigation.css` - Extracted CSS styles
3. `client/src/components/Logo.tsx` - Extracted logo component
4. `client/src/utils/routeConfig.ts` - Fixed route configuration
5. `client/src/App.tsx` - Improved prefetching logic with useMemo
6. `client/src/utils/bootstrapInit.ts` - Bootstrap initialization utility

## Testing

After these fixes, the navbar should:
- Render properly for all users who clone the repo
- Work without Bootstrap JavaScript in fallback mode
- Have better performance with external CSS
- Handle errors gracefully
- Work on all devices and screen sizes

## Dependencies Required

Ensure these are installed:
```bash
npm install bootstrap@^5.3.3 lucide-react@^0.536.0
```

The navbar will now work even if Bootstrap JavaScript fails to load, with graceful degradation.
